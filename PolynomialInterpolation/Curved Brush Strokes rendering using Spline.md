## Introduction
Rendering curved brushstrokes using splines is a technique commonly used in digital painting and computer graphics to create smooth  lines that mimic the look of traditional brushstrokes.
## Basic step-by-step overview
### 1. Determine Stroke Properties:
- The factors that influence the shape of a stroke in traditional art inform the digital simulation process. By adjusting brush attributes such as **size**, **opacity**, **color**, and **texture** along the spline, a more natural brushstroke is created. The goal is to mimic the effects produced by the artist's **speed**, **pressure**, and **brush angle** on different textures of canvas.
### 2. Define the Spline:
- Start by defining a spline, which is a smooth curve specified by a series of control points. Common types of splines include Bézier curves, B-splines, and Catmull-Rom splines.
  
| Feature                             | Bézier Curves                                                  | B-Splines                                                                      | Catmull-Rom Splines                                                      |

| **Control Points**                  | Curve is influenced by points but doesn't pass through them.   | Curve is influenced by points but doesn't pass through them.                   | Curve passes through each control point.                                 |
| **Smoothness**                      | Smooth but can get complex with more control points.           | Highly smooth due to the blending of control points; smoothness is adjustable. | Automatically smooth with guaranteed transitions through control points. |
| **Flexibility**                     | Moderate flexibility; adding more points increases complexity. | High flexibility; can represent very complex shapes efficiently.               | Less flexible in shape control since it passes through each point.       |
| **Local Control**                   | Limited: moving one point affects the entire curve.            | Good: changes mainly affect local areas.                                       | Moderate: changes in control points affect nearby segments.              |
| **Application in Stroke Rendering** | Good for simple, straightforward strokes.                      | Great for complex, smooth strokes.                                             | Best for paths that require smooth transitions.                          |
| **Computation Complexity**          | Low, easy to implement.                                        | Higher, more processing needed.                                                | Moderate, between Bézier and B-Splines.                                  |
- The spline will serve as the path that your brushstroke will follow.
### 3. Construct the Spline curve:
- The construction of a spline curve is based on what are called **control points** or **knots**.  These knots are defined at specific points along the path that a brush takes as it moves. Each knot captures a "snapshot" of the brush’s shape at that moment in time.
- The brush characteristics recorded at fixed periods become the control knots of the curve.
### 4. Render the Brushstroke:
- At each **knot**, render a brush stamp. The appearance of each stamp can vary based on the spline’s curvature, the distance between points, and the brush attributes you’ve set.
- As the brush moves along the spline, capture the variations in its attributes (e.g., how pressure changes the width) at each knot.
- Hand-drawn strokes are rarely as uniform in thickness as those generated by computer. Thus, a requirement in simulating this traditional media is the simulation of **lines of varying width**.
### 5. Stylistic Effects:
-  Apply additional effects like smudging, blending, texture, etc to achieve the desired aesthetic effect.
